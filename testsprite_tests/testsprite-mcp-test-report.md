### ⚠️ High Priority Issues

5. **Manager User Login Failure**
   - **Severity:** HIGH
   - **Impact:** Cannot test role-based access control fully
   - **Fix Required:** Create test users or verify credentials using `create-test-users.ts` script

6. **CSRF & Rate Limiting Not Fully Verified**
   - **Severity:** HIGH
   - **Impact:** Security features may not be properly enforced
   - **Fix Required:** Test with direct API calls, verify rate limiting on login endpoint

7. **Message History Not Displaying**
   - **Severity:** MEDIUM
   - **Impact:** Users cannot see sent messages
   - **Fix Required:** Verify message saving and query logic

8. **Missing Form Validation**
   - **Severity:** MEDIUM

   - **Fix Required:** Add recipient validation to MessageForm

### 📋 Medium Priority Issues

9. **Performance Metrics Not Measured**
   - **Severity:** LOW
   - **Impact:** Cannot verify Core Web Vitals compliance
   - **Fix Required:** Run Lighthouse audit, check bundle size

10. **Multiple Console Warnings**
    - **Severity:** LOW
    - **Impact:** Code quality and potential bugs
    - **Issues:**
      - Missing Dialog descriptions (accessibility)
      - Select component controlled/uncontrolled warnings
      - Appwrite configuration warnings
      - Server SDK used in browser warnings
    - **Fix Required:** Address warnings systematically

### 📊 Overall Assessment

**Current State:** The application has a solid foundation with working authentication, error handling, and accessibility features. However, critical issues prevent full functionality:

- ✅ **Working Well:** Authentication, session management, error handling, accessibility, settings management
- ❌ **Blocking Issues:** Icon serialization, backend connectivity, data persistence, input validation
- ⚠️ **Needs Attention:** RBAC testing, security verification, form validation, performance measurement

**Recommendation:** Address critical issues (icon serialization, backend connectivity, data persistence, input validation) before proceeding with additional feature development. These issues are blocking core functionality and pose security risks.

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix icon serialization issue (highest impact, affects multiple pages)
2. Verify and fix backend connectivity configuration
3. Debug data persistence issues (donations, beneficiaries)
4. Implement proper input validation and sanitization feedback
5. Create test users for RBAC testing
6. Verify CSRF and rate limiting with direct API testing
7. Address console warnings systematically
